		<br/>I started <b>accidentally</b> programming back in April 2020. Took a month or so to get comfortable in HTML, CSS, Designing and Hosting sites in Github Pages. Then accidentally started javascript. I dont remember much of the details now, but then TypeScript got my attention though I was novice to js world. I struggled with Objects, Classes, Prototypes, differences across node and browser. So, I decided to try a different languages and domains. Naturally, Desktop Applications had always my eye. So, It's a choice between C# or C++, while Rust held my curiosity. It's september already. Decided on C# and it taught me about Classes and Objects, atleast a bit. That made object-oriented a bit easier. TypeScript started to make sense and also, js and C#. Slowly, everything began to start making a union of sense. The journey so far by then, is more or less without any struggles, apart from the amount of time I spent. yeh, I spent a lot.

		Took a break in Nov-Dec 2020. Actually, because I don't have any ideas to continue working on projects. In the wake of new year, I started with React.js and a proper welcome to NodeJS. React influenced the first half of the year. I ported, learnt various frameworks under it and dug deep into front-end web finding SSGs, CSS tools, Bundlers.... etc. The second half of the year is the real deal of my programming journey. I learnt Rust at the end of May, soon Java, SQL...., Design Patterns, Writing tools or Writing real tools for real world. The pace of learning increased and so do the amount of stuff I want to learn. All I can do is to keep the curiosity at limit -----Dec-2021.
